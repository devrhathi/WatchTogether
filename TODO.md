## Milestone : 1

[x] Fix messages are echoing

[x] Handle The Youtube Events for synchronization - Failed, Did Not Work, Reason : Cannot Emit Play Pause without triggering default events, eventually creates infinite echoing of events
[x] Create New Player
[x] Design Basic Video Player
[x] Slide the slider when video is playing, end should be right most
[x] Seek functionality, tapping on slider seeks to that part in both devices and then plays it if it was playin, pauses it after seeking if it was paused before seeking
